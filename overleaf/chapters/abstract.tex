\section*{abstract}
In this project we are building a web-controlled surveillance robotic using raspberry pi and a webcam. This could be a valuable and modest security and spy device, which have numerous configurable alternatives. In this IOT Project, we are basically utilizing Raspberry Pi, camera module, 4 haggles cameras with robot body to fabricate this Robotic vehicle. The primary goal of this project is to build up a virtual environment for recognizing suspicious and targeted places for client with no loss of human life. It depends on development of a robot vehicle for observing/spying the suspicious objects. It can ceaselessly monitor the objects. Robot can move in all directions (left, right, forward and backward). It is utilized for video surveillance and remotely control the specific spot utilizing Wi-Fi as medium. The webcam which is put on the robotic unit will capture the video and it transmits lively to the remote end.
